# Pipe-Flow-
Contains the sources for the Lattice Boltzmann simulation of a periodic pipe flow with a square cylinder inside, and measure the force applied ont it by the fluid.

The flow can be driven by :
A pressure gradient imposed at the inlet/outlet.
A volumic force applied to the whole fluid. In that case the inlet/outlet are simply periodic.
